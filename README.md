# To Do List
This to-do list was created with the intention of learning how to combine all that I have learnt so far with my new knowledge of SOLID principles, decoupling via PubSub, and OOP theory.

## PubSub
The UI of this project is mostly decoupled from the inner-workings via the use of PubSub.

## Local Storage
This project makes use of Local Storage to save notes so that nothing is lost on refresh.

## Tools
This project makes use of a variety of tools, such as:
- NPM
- Webpack
- GitHub templates

## Languages
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
